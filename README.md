#  Weather Data Analysis and Prediction

This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and future temperature prediction using Python. It showcases your ability to work with real-world datasets, visualize trends, and build predictive models — ideal for portfolio and recruiter visibility.

##  Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Historical weather data with features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and pressure.
- **Tools Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- **Goals**:
  - Clean and preprocess time-series weather data
  - Visualize temperature trends and weather condition distributions
  - Build a linear regression model to predict temperature
  - Forecast future temperature values based on recent conditions

##  Key Features

- Time-based feature extraction (Year, Month, Day, Hour)
- Line plots for temperature trends
- Count plots for weather condition distribution
- Regression model evaluation (R² score, Mean Squared Error)
- Future temperature prediction using extrapolated features


##   Future Improvements
- Add support for other ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Dash
- Integrate real-time weather API for live predictions
